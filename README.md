- Linux Ubuntu 12.04 and above, Fedora 21 and Debian 8 (64-bit only)
- Windows 7 and above

### Node.js

- Node.js 10 or 12 and above

### GIT

$ npm install
```
### Test Execution
To run tests:
```$xslt
$ npx cypress run
```
> **Note:** The above command will run the test in the default browser(Electron) for Cypress in headless mode.

To specify a browser:
```
$ npx cypress run --browser <browsername>
```

To run in headless mode:
```
$ npx cypress run -browser <browsername> --headless
```
> **Note:** The tests run in headless mode by default for the electron browser.

### Overriding Options
Cypress gives you the option to dynamically alter configuration values. This is helpful when running Cypress in multiple environments and on multiple developer machines.

This gives you the option to do things like override the baseUrl or environment variables.

When running Cypress from the Command Line you can pass a --config flag.
### Examples:
```
$ cypress open --config pageLoadTimeout=30000,baseUrl=https://myapp.com
```
```
$ cypress run --config integrationFolder=tests,videoUploadOnPasses=false
```
